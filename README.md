# Churn-Prediction-Neural-Network

The project aims to forecast churn for Expresso, a telecommunications company, leveraging FFNN models to identify customers likely to leave for competitors or terminate services. The repository includes:
- a jupyter notebook titled "Churn_Prediction_FFNN" encompasses a comprehensive analysis aimed at predicting customer churn using Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN). It guides through data preprocessing, the construction and training of the neural network model and performance evaluation, demonstrating an end-to-end approach for leveraging machine learning techniques in addressing real-world business challenges.
- a report titled "Predicting Customer Churn using Feed-Forward Neural Networks" detailing the data preprocessing, model architecture, training process, and evaluation results, emphasizing the predictive power of neural networks in identifying at-risk customers to inform retention strategies effectively.
